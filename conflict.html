								<h3>The Social Conflicts</h3>
								<p>With the political misguidance of the Hoover Administration, industrial leaders were not able to pay their workers and so many lost their jobs. This stirred up a great deal of unemployment in the time period. President Hoover's inability to take action cost him support and made many despise him for nottaking action.</p>

								<p>The unemployment rate at its peak during the year 1933 was at 25% which was about 12 million workers in the industry. Makeshift sheds were made to supplement for the poverty-ridden streets where the homeless lay, these "shantytowns" of makeshit sheds were dubbed the name "Hoovervilles"</p>

								<h4>The Economic Conflicts</h4>
								<p>Once the stock market crashed, the overall value had drastically declined by 80% and throttled American Investors into a grand panic. The crash caused for more than a billion dollars to just disappear which also made for a national acute deflation.</p>

								<p>Two out of every five American banks collapsed which only made matters worse for the populous because it meant that people who tried to secure their money in the bank lost it entirely as the bank did not insure the money. This would later result in over $7 billion to be lost for hardworking employees.</p>
